# Simple logging library for C++.

A basic log to file.

The log allows for the usual levels of input, but can be cut at any level to 
produce smaller files. It also has locking capabilities for multithreading and 
date/time formats.

# What are all these branches?

Ignore them all. Just use master, really. Classic was supposed to be the one that was in the old libdansdl2, not-so-classic was supposed to be an intermediate state and master is supposed to be a refactor. Just go with master.

# How does it work?

- Choose the kind of log you want to use (to an output stream, nowhere, 
  to file...).
- Instance it.
- Use the "sentries" to log. Sentries are instanced either by
	- log::lock(logger_instance, level) //With locking capabiities for
	  multithreaded applications.
	- log::log(logger_instance, level)
- Sentries are used as if they were streams (log::lock(logger, lvl::info)<<"Hello"<<std::endl;

# What is this level mask thing?

It allows you to filter out certain log levels. Check the example in mask.cpp.
